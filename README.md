# Introduction:
This project aims to develop an intelligent traffic management system using YOLO V5 and Intel OneAPI toolkit to address the problem of traffic congestion in cities around the world. The system will consist of cameras placed at different intersections and roads to capture live video feeds of the traffic. The YOLO V5 algorithm will be used to detect and classify vehicles on the road. The system will be trained on a large dataset of different types of vehicles to improve its accuracy. The system will also monitor the traffic flow and adjust traffic signals accordingly to improve the flow of traffic.

Number Plate Detection using OpenCV-Python 4.5.3.56 or above:
In addition to the vehicle detection and traffic management system, this project also includes number plate detection using OpenCV-Python 4.5.3.56 or above. The number plate detection module is developed using image processing techniques, and it can detect and recognize the number plates of vehicles passing through the camera feeds. The module requires the following dependencies to be installed:

numpy 1.20.0 or above
python 3.9 or above
numpy 1.20.0 or above
OpenCV-Python 4.5.3.56 or above
To use the number plate detection module, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
Import the 'cv2' module in your Python script.
Call the 'detect_number_plate' function by passing the image file path as an argument.
The function will return a list of detected number plates in the image.
For example, the following code can be used to detect number plates in an image:

python
Copy code
import cv2

# load the image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

# detect number plates
number_plates = detect_number_plate(img)

# print the detected number plates
print(number_plates)
Conclusion:
The proposed intelligent traffic management system using YOLO V5 and Intel OneAPI toolkit, along with the number plate detection module, has the potential to significantly improve the flow of traffic, reduce congestion, and make commuting safer and more efficient. The system can be further improved in the future by integrating with other technologies, expanding to other cities, adding pedestrian detection, using predictive analytics, implementing smart parking solutions, using edge computing, and integrating with autonomous vehicles.
